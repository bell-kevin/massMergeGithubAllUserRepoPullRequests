# Mass Merge Github Pull Requests

Very often, if not always, I don't want to spend lots of time merging pull requests, especially if I already know they are good and safe pull requests, so here is a program that saves you, potentially, lots of time in terms of having to manually merge pull requests one by one.

Step 1: Install Python. If you haven’t already, you’ll need to install Python on your computer. You can download it from the official website: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Step 2: Install the requests library. Once Python is installed, you’ll need to install the requests library, which allows you to send HTTP requests in Python. Open your command prompt or terminal and type the following command:

pip install requests

Step 3: Get your GitHub Personal Access Token. You’ll need a GitHub Personal Access Token to authenticate your script with GitHub’s API. Here’s how you can get it:

1. Go to GitHub and log in to your account.
2. Click on your profile picture in the top right corner and select Settings.
3. In the left sidebar, click on Developer settings.
4. Click on Personal access tokens.
5. Click on Generate new token.
6. Give your token a description, select the scopes (permissions) you want to grant this token (for this script, you’ll need repo scope), and click Generate token.
7. Important: Be sure to copy your new personal access token now. You won’t be able to see it again!

Step 4: Create the Python script. Create a new Python file (.py) on your computer (using Visual Studio Code) and copy the following code into it. Replace 'your-token' with the Personal Access Token you generated in the previous step 

Step 5: Run the script. Save the Python file and run it from your command prompt or terminal by navigating to the directory where you saved the file and typing python filename.py, replacing filename with the name of your Python file.

Note: This script merges pull requests without any review or checks. Please use it responsibly. Also, ensure that your token has the necessary permissions to read and write pull requests.

Remember, this is a simple script and may not cover all use cases. You might need to modify it according to your needs. For example, you might want to add error checking, handle pagination if you have more than 30 pull requests in a repository (as GitHub’s API pages results), or add conditions for which pull requests should be merged.

Also, please be aware that mass merging pull requests can have unintended consequences, such as skipping important code reviews or merging changes that conflict with each other. It’s generally recommended to review each pull request individually to ensure the quality and integrity of your code.

If you’re dealing with a large number of repositories and pull requests regularly, you might want to consider using a tool or service that provides more advanced automation and management features. There are several third-party services and tools available that provide more advanced features for managing pull requests and repositories on GitHub.

== We're Using GitHub Under Protest ==

This project is currently hosted on GitHub.  This is not ideal; GitHub is a
proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce Software
(FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system like GitHub
to develop our FOSS project. I have a [website](https://bellKevin.me) where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we can move away from GitHub
in the long term.  We urge you to read about the [Give up GitHub](https://GiveUpGitHub.org) campaign 
from [the Software Freedom Conservancy](https://sfconservancy.org) to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not 
a good place to host FOSS projects.

If you are a contributor who personally has already quit using GitHub, please
email me at **bellKevin@pm.me** for how to send us contributions without
using GitHub directly.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
